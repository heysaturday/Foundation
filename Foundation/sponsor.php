         <h3>Building for Babies</h3>
             
             <p><img src="images/Building-for-Babies-logo_web.png" align="left" width="150"/>Every new mom knows the feeling... you want your first moments with your newborn to be a “5-star” experience in every way. You want to bring your incredible baby into an environment that is beautiful, restful, modern and welcoming. After all, it’s not your grandmother’s generation – so why settle for a Maternity department that looks like it did when she was a new mom!</p>
             
             <p>The Onslow Memorial Hospital Foundation couldn’t agree more! That’s why “Building for Babies” has been identified as our 2017- 2018 Annual Giving Campaign.</p>
             
             <p>In the months ahead, we will be fundraising for significant improvements to the Maternal Child Services Floor which includes Labor &amp; Delivery, Nursery, Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and Pediatrics. There is a lot of work to be done, and your active engagement is needed! We owe it to all the moms-to-be in Onslow County to make our facility the very best.</p>
             
             <p>Now more than ever, we need your support. Every gift to our Building for Babies Campaign is vitally important to further our mission to provide compassionate care, with best services and the newest technology in the most pleasing of environments for all of our moms and babies.</p>

             <p>Let’s take Onslow Memorial Hospital’s Maternal Child Services floor to a whole new level. Let’s go all the way to “5-star” – and let’s begin now!</p>

		   <h3>Caring Spirit Program</h3>
            <p><strong>Give a gift in honor of an employee</strong><BR />
           The doctors, nurses, employees, and volunteers of Onslow Memorial Hospital play a critical role in patients' healing—both physically and emotionally. The Caring Spirit program gives you the opportunity to express your gratitude for an employee by making a gift in his or her honor. When making a gift, you can write a personal note of appreciation that will be delivered to the employee along with a special Caring Spirit lapel pin. Making a gift through the Caring Spirit program is a heartfelt, meaningful way to say thank you to an employee who has made a difference in your life. If you are interested in making a Caring Spirit gift, contact Lee Ann Thomas at (910) 577-2651, email at <a href="mailto:Leeann.Thomas@onslow.org">Leeann.Thomas@onslow.org</a>, or <a href="pdfs/CaringSpiritDonationForm.pdf">click here</a>.</p>
